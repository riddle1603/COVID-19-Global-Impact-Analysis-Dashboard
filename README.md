# COVID-19-Global-Impact-Analysis-Dashboard
Analyzed global COVID-19 cases, deaths, and infection rates using SQL and visualized insights through an interactive Tableau dashboard.

##Project Description 
This project focuses on analyzing the global impact of COVID-19 by examining confirmed cases, deaths, death percentages, and population-level infection rates. Using SQL, raw COVID-19 datasets were cleaned, aggregated, and analyzed to uncover key trends across countries and continents. The insights were then visualized using Tableau, enabling interactive exploration of COVID-19 spread, mortality, and regional comparisons over time.
